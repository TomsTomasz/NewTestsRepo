This is my first serious c# project. Its an ASCII art converter.
There is lot of spaghetti code (enjoy!).
First idea was to convert img to string, then append ASCII chars and then convert it to img and display it in PictureBox2.
Due to lack of my skills I was not able to convert ascii string to img.
I also tried to convert it to string and show in textbox but it was not scaling properly.
You can see there is commented stuff- I left it as an idea if I ever come back to this project. Maybe it will help me.
Anyway this is the first one. It saves txt file to given catalog (File.WriteAllText -> path).
I recommend to change the size of notepad file after converting stuff. I dont know yet how to change size of the string.
Anyway enjoy :) as I said it is my first project, I am also aware that lof of stuff has been written in WinForm Class instead of Main.
