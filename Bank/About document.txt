This is my first CRUD app.
There is lot of garbage in the code since it was my first normal project.
Its Windows Form app which contains Bank Menu. After picking an option you could add some accounts etc.
It is connected to the DB.

I basically took the online course on https://zajacmarek.com/kurs-programowania-c-sharp/ and add some features.
Most likely it wont work now since I was trying to make some changes in the entity framework but I messed up.
